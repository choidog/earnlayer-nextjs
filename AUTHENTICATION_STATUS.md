# Authentication Fix Status Update

## Current Status: ✅ Fix Implemented by Frontend Team

The frontend developer has correctly identified and implemented fixes for the authentication domain mismatch issue.

## Root Cause Confirmed
- **Issue**: Better Auth configuration was using wrong domain (`vercel.app` instead of `app.earnlayerai.com`)
- **Impact**: Session cookies not being sent with API requests, causing 401 errors
- **Solution**: Update domain configuration and add missing environment variables

## Frontend Team's Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Fixed domain configuration in auth config
2. ✅ Updated cookie domain from `.earnlayer.com` to `.earnlayerai.com` 
3. ✅ Added trusted origins for `app.earnlayerai.com`
4. ✅ Added debug logging to agreement API endpoints
5. ✅ Created Railway deployment instructions

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Add Environment Variables to Railway
```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://app.earnlayerai.com
FRONTEND_DOMAIN=https://app.earnlayerai.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://app.earnlayerai.com
```

### 2. Deploy Updated Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix authentication domain configuration for app.earnlayerai.com"
git push
```

### 3. Verify Fix
After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET https://app.earnlayerai.com/api/agreement/current` (should return 200)
- `GET https://app.earnlayerai.com/api/agreement/status` (should return 200 when authenticated)

## Expected Resolution
Once deployed, the agreement system should work correctly:
- ✅ No more 401 authentication errors
- ✅ Agreement status API calls succeed
- ✅ Agreement acceptance flow works properly
- ✅ Session cookies persist across page loads

## Monitoring
The frontend team has added debug logging to help monitor the fix:
- Session validation logs in agreement API endpoints
- Cookie and header inspection for troubleshooting

## Confidence Level: HIGH
The frontend developer correctly identified the exact issue and implemented appropriate fixes. This should resolve the authentication problems completely.
