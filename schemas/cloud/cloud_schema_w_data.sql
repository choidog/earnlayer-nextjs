From innovative applications in healthcare and education to pressing concerns around security and ethical considerations, AI continues its relentless march forward, reshaping industries and prompting important societal discussions.\n   - One of the most notable stories centers on the rapid adoption of AI by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The agency has launched "INTACT," its first agency-wide AI tool, designed to enhance operational efficiency, streamline regulatory processes, and improve risk assessment. This marks a significant step towards AI-driven government transformation, demonstrating a commitment to leveraging AI for public service.\n   - However, the proliferation of AI also brings new challenges. Cybersecurity researchers have raised alarms about new malicious AI variants based on WormGPT, including strains built on popular models like Grok and Mixtral. These tools are being weaponized to automate phishing attacks and malware creation with advanced precision, highlighting the urgent need for stronger AI safety and security protocols.\n   - Education is another area witnessing significant AI integration. Mississippi has partnered with Nvidia to launch a statewide AI education initiative for middle and high school students, aiming to prepare the next generation for technology careers. Similarly, Google continues its investment in AI for education, offering free access to tools like Gemini Advanced for college students and expanding AI literacy programs.\n   - Beyond government and education, individual achievements are also making headlines. A remarkable example is 16-year-old Pranjali Awasthi, who founded Delv.AI, a $12 million AI research startup focused on making academic data more accessible with Large Language Models (LLMs). Her inspiring story underscores the potential for young innovators to contribute significantly to the AI landscape.\n   - On the ethical front, Wikipedia editors are pushing back against the increasing use of AI-generated content on the platform, citing concerns about accuracy, tone, and proper citation. This backlash reflects broader tensions between human moderation and machine-generated information, prompting discussions about maintaining quality and trustworthiness in the age of AI. Even religious leaders are weighing in, with Pope Leo XIV expressing concerns about AI's impact on youth development and urging developers to embed human dignity in AI design.\n\n2. **The Evolving Landscape of AI Regulation: A Global Shift Towards Economic Harness**\n   - Toronto, ON – June 22, 2025 – The global conversation around Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulation is undergoing a significant pivot, moving away from an exclusive focus on safety and warnings towards a more concerted effort to harness AI's economic benefits. This shift was underscored by Canada's new Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation, Evan Solomon, in a recent address, signalling a broader trend among nations.\n   - Minister Solomon, in his inaugural speech, emphasized that Canada will no longer "over-index on warnings and regulation," but instead prioritize ways to maximize the economic advantages offered by AI. While acknowledging the need to protect data and privacy, he suggested that a rigid, singular approach to AI regulation is impractical given the rapid pace of technological development and the varying interests of global players. "The United States and China have no desire to buy into any constraint or regulation," Solomon stated, highlighting the challenges of unilateral regulatory efforts.\n   - This sentiment echoes a broader shift observed internationally. The initial global summits on AI safety, which heavily emphasized existential risks, are giving way to forums with a wider scope, now encompassing adoption strategies and economic integration. For instance, the recent AI Action Summit in Paris saw a distinct pushback against overly restrictive European regulatory efforts from the US Vice-President.\n   - Canada's new approach aims to foster its domestic AI industry, drive adoption across various sectors, and ensure Canadian trust and sovereignty over the technology. This includes government investments in data centers and research, intellectual property protection, and a strong focus on commercialization. The goal is to champion Canadian AI companies and encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to embrace AI, positioning the country to lead in this "Guttenberg moment" of technological revolution.\n   - While the need for ethical guidelines and safeguards remains, particularly concerning data protection and privacy, the overarching message from many governments is clear: the future of AI lies in defining, shaping, and leading its transformative potential for economic growth and innovation, rather than solely attempting to constrain it.	f	2025-07-03 19:06:17.141408+00

Source: CNBC/Screenshot\\n\\nA solo developer just sold his six-month-old ‘side-project’ for $80M: Maor Shlomo’s vibe-coding platform Base44, which helps non-programmers design their own software, was acquired by Wix as it looks to add more AI features to its website-building platform.\\n\\nWhile Shlomo’s startup didn’t stay “solo” for long (it eventually grew to include nine employees in total), its rate of growth and profitability, generating $189,000 of profit in May alone, would have been unheard of even a couple of years ago.\\n\\nAnother surprising application: Two AI avatars, trained on a real-life influencer and his co-host in China, just raised $7.65M in just seven hours via a livestream where they showed off different products. That’s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\\n\\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It’s to the point where a solo unicorn — a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation — doesn’t sound quite so far-fetched anymore. To keep up, bigger corporations will need to carve out small, nimble teams where employees can experiment and put AI to use in unexpected ways."\n    },\n    {\n      "title": "Veo dethroned by Chinese rivals",\n      "content": "Welcome back, Superhuman.

AI Continues Rapid Evolution\n**Content:**\nThe past few days have seen a flurry of activity in the world of Artificial Intelligence, with breakthroughs and significant advancements emerging across diverse sectors. From innovative applications in healthcare and education to pressing concerns around security and ethical considerations, AI continues its relentless march forward, reshaping industries and prompting important societal discussions.\n\nOne of the most notable stories centers on the rapid adoption of AI by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The agency has launched "INTACT," its first agency-wide AI tool, designed to enhance operational efficiency, streamline regulatory processes, and improve risk assessment. This marks a significant step towards AI-driven government transformation, demonstrating a commitment to leveraging AI for public service.\n\nHowever, the proliferation of AI also brings new challenges. Cybersecurity researchers have raised alarms about new malicious AI variants based on WormGPT, including strains built on popular models like Grok and Mixtral. These tools are being weaponized to automate phishing attacks and malware creation with advanced precision, highlighting the urgent need for stronger AI safety and security protocols.\n\nEducation is another area witnessing significant AI integration. Mississippi has partnered with Nvidia to launch a statewide AI education initiative for middle and high school students, aiming to prepare the next generation for technology careers. Similarly, Google continues its investment in AI for education, offering free access to tools like Gemini Advanced for college students and expanding AI literacy programs.\n\nBeyond government and education, individual achievements are also making headlines. A remarkable example is 16-year-old Pranjali Awasthi, who founded Delv.AI, a $12 million AI research startup focused on making academic data more accessible with Large Language Models (LLMs). Her inspiring story underscores the potential for young innovators to contribute significantly to the AI landscape.\n\nOn the ethical front, Wikipedia editors are pushing back against the increasing use of AI-generated content on the platform, citing concerns about accuracy, tone, and proper citation. This backlash reflects broader tensions between human moderation and machine-generated information, prompting discussions about maintaining quality and trustworthiness in the age of AI. Even religious leaders are weighing in, with Pope Leo XIV expressing concerns about AI's impact on youth development and urging developers to embed human dignity in AI design.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Evolving Landscape of AI Regulation\n**Content:**\nThe global conversation around Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulation is undergoing a significant pivot, moving away from an exclusive focus on safety and warnings towards a more concerted effort to harness AI's economic benefits. This shift was underscored by Canada's new Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation, Evan Solomon, in a recent address, signalling a broader trend among nations.\n\nMinister Solomon, in his inaugural speech, emphasized that Canada will no longer "over-index on warnings and regulation," but instead prioritize ways to maximize the economic advantages offered by AI. While acknowledging the need to protect data and privacy, he suggested that a rigid, singular approach to AI regulation is impractical given the rapid pace of technological development and the varying interests of global players. "The United States and China have no desire to buy into any constraint or regulation," Solomon stated, highlighting the challenges of unilateral regulatory efforts.\n\nThis sentiment echoes a broader shift observed internationally. The initial global summits on AI safety, which heavily emphasized existential risks, are giving way to forums with a wider scope, now encompassing adoption strategies and economic integration. For instance, the recent AI Action Summit in Paris saw a distinct pushback against overly restrictive European regulatory efforts from the US Vice-President.\n\nCanada's new approach aims to foster its domestic AI industry, drive adoption across various sectors, and ensure Canadian trust and sovereignty over the technology. This includes government investments in data centers and research, intellectual property protection, and a strong focus on commercialization. The goal is to champion Canadian AI companies and encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to embrace AI, positioning the country to lead in this "Guttenberg moment" of technological revolution.\n\nWhile the need for ethical guidelines and safeguards remains, particularly concerning data protection and privacy, the overarching message from many governments is clear: the future of AI lies in defining, shaping, and leading its transformative potential for economic growth and innovation, rather than solely attempting to constrain it.	f	2025-07-04 15:38:17.942289+00

Two new video models jump past Veo 3 on major benchmark: Since Google’s Veo 3 release last month, it’s been the undisputed champion of VLMs — even making its way to primetime TV spots and Hollywood-backed short films. But its lead didn’t last for long: Artificial Analysis’s crowd-sourced leaderboard just ranked ByteDance’s Seedance 1.0 ahead of Veo across multiple categories. Meanwhile, MiniMax just revealed that a mysterious VLM known as “Kangaroo,” which beats Veo in image-to-video, is actually a brand-new model called Hailuo 02. The shakeup proves that Chinese AI companies are managing to stay competitive with their US counterparts.\\n\\n2. TikTok unveils new AI video tools: ByteDance just gave marketers an entirely new way to promote their products on TikTok. Advertisers can now generate five-second clips with either text or image prompts, then stitch them together to “bring a full product catalog to life.” For example, you can upload an image of a car, and then generate a video of it driving through a desert landscape. You can also prompt AI avatars to talk about your product and show it off, or even model your brand’s clothing.\\n\\n3. Adobe is helping brands brace for AI’s search shakeup: Retail sites saw a staggering 3,500% spike in traffic coming from generative AI sources in the past year. But while consumers are quickly embracing chatbot-based shopping, analytics tools have struggled to keep up. Adobe’s new LLM Optimizer aims to fix that — helping companies track how their content performs across AI platforms.

The one thing holding it back: Microsoft won’t budge on the details out of fear it’ll get burned in the process.\\n\\nHigh Stakes: According to the Wall Street Journal, the feud has gotten so heated that OpenAI is now considering going public with its accusations.

For inspiration, you can scroll down to see what others have created, like a London airspace tracker, a virtual museum tour, and an SEO dashboard — complete with the prompts they used.\\n\\n2. Little-known startup races to fill Scale AI-shaped hole: With Meta purchasing a 49% stake in Scale and major players like OpenAI and Google heading for the door, an obscure startup called Surge AI is stepping out of the shadows as a worthy replacement. Like Scale, the 110-person company labels data for training frontier models. But it brought in $1B last year, fully bootstrapped, while $29B-valued Scale made only $870M in the same period. Surge is just one of a growing number of data-labeling startups that could stand to benefit from the Scale shakeup.\\n\\n3. MIT builds model that can continually teach itself: One thing that separates us from AI is that we have the ability to pick up new information and adjust our worldview accordingly. But that skill might not be exclusive to humans for long. MIT researchers developed a technique called Self Adapting Language Models (SEAL) that lets LLMs adjust their own parameters as they learn. The approach boosted the performance of Meta’s Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen, although pushing the models too much can actually lead them to start forgetting things.\\n\\n**FROM THE FRONTIER**\\nAI is fueling a ‘solopreneur’ boom\\n\\nAI is getting so good, it can now replace real-life hosts.

You can also prompt AI avatars to talk about your product and show it off, or even model your brand’s clothing.\\n\\n3. Adobe is helping brands brace for AI’s search shakeup: Retail sites saw a staggering 3,500% spike in traffic coming from generative AI sources in the past year. But while consumers are quickly embracing chatbot-based shopping, analytics tools have struggled to keep up.

Source: CNBC/Screenshot\\n\\nA solo developer just sold his six-month-old ‘side-project’ for $80M: Maor Shlomo’s vibe-coding platform Base44, which helps non-programmers design their own software, was acquired by Wix as it looks to add more AI features to its website-building platform.\\n\\nWhile Shlomo’s startup didn’t stay “solo” for long (it eventually grew to include nine employees in total), its rate of growth and profitability, generating $189,000 of profit in May alone, would have been unheard of even a couple of years ago.\\n\\nAnother surprising application: Two AI avatars, trained on a real-life influencer and his co-host in China, just raised $7.65M in just seven hours via a livestream where they showed off different products. That’s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\\n\\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It’s to the point where a solo unicorn — a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation — doesn’t sound quite so far-fetched anymore. To keep up, bigger corporations will need to carve out small, nimble teams where employees can experiment and put AI to use in unexpected ways.\\n\\n**AI ACADEMY**\\nHow to generate ChatGPT images in WhatsApp\\n\\nOpen WhatsApp on your phone.\\n\\nSend the message “Link my WhatsApp with ChatGPT” to 1-800-ChatGPT.\\n\\nYou’ll receive a link—tap it to connect your WhatsApp with your ChatGPT account\\n\\nNow you can prompt ChatGPT within WhatsApp to generate images for you.\\n\\nSample Prompt: Can you create me a white fluffy cat made of rice wrapped in a strip of seaweed around its stomach\\n\\nWait a few seconds, and ChatGPT will generate an image for you.\\n\\n**IN THE KNOW**\\nWhat’s trending on socials and headlines today\\n\\nWatch what happened when a UCLA graduate showed off all his ChatGPT-generated final projects during his graduation ceremony.\\n\\n🎓 Masterful Move: Duolingo built a full chess course from scratch with just two employees and the AI coding tool Cursor.

But now that OpenAI has become a massively successful tech company in its own right, it wants more independence and flexibility.\\n\\nHow so? OpenAI has been trying for months to transform into a public-benefit corporation, giving it a chance to turn a profit and accelerate its growth. The one thing holding it back: Microsoft won’t budge on the details out of fear it’ll get burned in the process.\\n\\nHigh Stakes: According to the Wall Street Journal, the feud has gotten so heated that OpenAI is now considering going public with its accusations. It could also ask the federal government to investigate Microsoft for antitrust violations.\\n\\nNot so fast: In a joint statement, both companies agreed they’re “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” hinting that there might still be time to smooth things over.\\n\\n**AI & TECH NEWS**\\nEverything else you need to know today\\n\\nA team of researchers used GPT-4.1 and o3-mini-high to shave off years of research time.

Source: Gallup\\n\\nThe US’s second-largest employer just dropped the hammer. In a new memo to his 1.5M+ employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy revealed that the company will likely see some job cuts in the near future as generative AI floods “virtually every corner of the company.”\\n\\nBut it’s not as grim as it sounds: Jassy said that while some positions are bound to be automated, other types of jobs will open up. Some of the best ways to prepare: “Be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms.”\\n\\nA new Gallup poll suggests many of us are already well on our way: About 40% of American employees have used AI at least a few times in the past year, up from just 21% the year before. Meanwhile, nearly one in five employees count themselves as frequent AI users, relying on LLMs at least a few times a week for work. (A new Microsoft report has some tips to help ease the transition.)\\n\\nWhat it means: In the past few months, we’ve finally seen CEOs be more upfront about AI’s impact on jobs.

Source: CNBC/Screenshot\\n\\nA solo developer just sold his six-month-old ‘side-project’ for $80M: Maor Shlomo’s vibe-coding platform Base44, which helps non-programmers design their own software, was acquired by Wix as it looks to add more AI features to its website-building platform.\\n\\nWhile Shlomo’s startup didn’t stay “solo” for long (it eventually grew to include nine employees in total), its rate of growth and profitability, generating $189,000 of profit in May alone, would have been unheard of even a couple of years ago.\\n\\nAnother surprising application: Two AI avatars, trained on a real-life influencer and his co-host in China, just raised $7.65M in just seven hours via a livestream where they showed off different products. That’s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\\n\\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It’s to the point where a solo unicorn — a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation — doesn’t sound quite so far-fetched anymore. To keep up, bigger corporations will need to carve out small, nimble teams where employees can experiment and put AI to use in unexpected ways."\n    },\n    {\n      "title": "Veo dethroned by Chinese rivals",\n      "text": "Welcome back, Superhuman.

But its lead didn’t last for long: Artificial Analysis’s crowd-sourced leaderboard just ranked ByteDance’s Seedance 1.0 ahead of Veo across multiple categories. Meanwhile, MiniMax just revealed that a mysterious VLM known as “Kangaroo,” which beats Veo in image-to-video, is actually a brand-new model called Hailuo 02. The shakeup proves that Chinese AI companies are managing to stay competitive with their US counterparts.\\n\\n2. TikTok unveils new AI video tools: ByteDance just gave marketers an entirely new way to promote their products on TikTok. Advertisers can now generate five-second clips with either text or image prompts, then stitch them together to “bring a full product catalog to life.” For example, you can upload an image of a car, and then generate a video of it driving through a desert landscape. You can also prompt AI avatars to talk about your product and show it off, or even model your brand’s clothing.\\n\\n3. Adobe is helping brands brace for AI’s search shakeup: Retail sites saw a staggering 3,500% spike in traffic coming from generative AI sources in the past year.

But now that OpenAI has become a massively successful tech company in its own right, it wants more independence and flexibility.\\n\\nHow so? OpenAI has been trying for months to transform into a public-benefit corporation, giving it a chance to turn a profit and accelerate its growth. The one thing holding it back: Microsoft won’t budge on the details out of fear it’ll get burned in the process.\\n\\nHigh Stakes: According to the Wall Street Journal, the feud has gotten so heated that OpenAI is now considering going public with its accusations. It could also ask the federal government to investigate Microsoft for antitrust violations.\\n\\nNot so fast: In a joint statement, both companies agreed they’re “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” hinting that there might still be time to smooth things over.\\n\\n**AI & TECH NEWS**\\nEverything else you need to know today\\n\\nA team of researchers used GPT-4.1 and o3-mini-high to shave off years of research time.

Source: Gallup\\n\\nThe US’s second-largest employer just dropped the hammer. In a new memo to his 1.5M+ employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy revealed that the company will likely see some job cuts in the near future as generative AI floods “virtually every corner of the company.”\\n\\nBut it’s not as grim as it sounds: Jassy said that while some positions are bound to be automated, other types of jobs will open up. Some of the best ways to prepare: “Be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms.”\\n\\nA new Gallup poll suggests many of us are already well on our way: About 40% of American employees have used AI at least a few times in the past year, up from just 21% the year before. Meanwhile, nearly one in five employees count themselves as frequent AI users, relying on LLMs at least a few times a week for work. (A new Microsoft report has some tips to help ease the transition.)\\n\\nWhat it means: In the past few months, we’ve finally seen CEOs be more upfront about AI’s impact on jobs. While that transparency can be daunting, it’s also an exciting time for the workforce. We have an active role in reshaping our daily workflows and can proactively create the jobs we envision.\\n\\n**AI & TECH NEWS**\\nEverything else you need to know today\\n\\nKrea’s new image model breaks new ground in the photorealism department.

It might be time to change your password. Researchers claim they’ve uncovered one of the largest data hacks ever recorded. If confirmed, it’d mean up to 16B of our private credentials from platforms like Google and Apple might be compromised.\\n\\nAlso today: Learn how to generate ChatGPT images in WhatsApp, and get the latest AI tools and trending social media posts.\\n\\nTODAY IN AI\\n\\nMiniMax is going after rivals like OpenAI and Butterfly Effect with a browser-based agent. Source: MiniMax\\n\\n1. You can now try MiniMax’s general agent for yourself: The Alibaba-backed startup is bringing its models’ reasoning capabilities to the masses. MiniMax Agent lets you spin up coding projects, reports, and slideshows alongside an autonomous AI teammate that seems at least on par with fellow Chinese counterpart Manus. For inspiration, you can scroll down to see what others have created, like a London airspace tracker, a virtual museum tour, and an SEO dashboard — complete with the prompts they used.\\n\\n2. Little-known startup races to fill Scale AI-shaped hole: With Meta purchasing a 49% stake in Scale and major players like OpenAI and Google heading for the door, an obscure startup called Surge AI is stepping out of the shadows as a worthy replacement. Like Scale, the 110-person company labels data for training frontier models. But it brought in $1B last year, fully bootstrapped, while $29B-valued Scale made only $870M in the same period. Surge is just one of a growing number of data-labeling startups that could stand to benefit from the Scale shakeup.\\n\\n3. MIT builds model that can continually teach itself: One thing that separates us from AI is that we have the ability to pick up new information and adjust our worldview accordingly. But that skill might not be exclusive to humans for long. MIT researchers developed a technique called Self Adapting Language Models (SEAL) that lets LLMs adjust their own parameters as they learn. The approach boosted the performance of Meta’s Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen, although pushing the models too much can actually lead them to start forgetting things.\\n\\nFROM THE FRONTIER\\nAI is fueling a ‘solopreneur’ boom\\n\\nAI is getting so good, it can now replace real-life hosts. Source: CNBC/Screenshot\\n\\nA solo developer just sold his six-month-old ‘side-project’ for $80M: Maor Shlomo’s vibe-coding platform Base44, which helps non-programmers design their own software, was acquired by Wix as it looks to add more AI features to its website-building platform.\\n\\nWhile Shlomo’s startup didn’t stay “solo” for long (it eventually grew to include nine employees in total), its rate of growth and profitability, generating $189,000 of profit in May alone, would have been unheard of even a couple of years ago.\\n\\nAnother surprising application: Two AI avatars, trained on a real-life influencer and his co-host in China, just raised $7.65M in just seven hours via a livestream where they showed off different products. That’s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\\n\\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It’s to the point where a solo unicorn — a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation — doesn’t sound quite so far-fetched anymore. To keep up, bigger corporations will need to carve out small, nimble teams where employees can experiment and put AI to use in unexpected ways."\n    },\n    {\n      "title": "Gemini 2.5 unleashed",\n      "text": "Welcome back, Superhuman.

It might be time to change your password. Researchers claim they’ve uncovered one of the largest data hacks ever recorded. If confirmed, it’d mean up to 16B of our private credentials from platforms like Google and Apple might be compromised.\\n\\nAlso today: Learn how to generate ChatGPT images in WhatsApp, and get the latest AI tools and trending social media posts.\\n\\n**TODAY IN AI**\\n\\nMiniMax is going after rivals like OpenAI and Butterfly Effect with a browser-based agent. Source: MiniMax\\n\\n1. You can now try MiniMax’s general agent for yourself: The Alibaba-backed startup is bringing its models’ reasoning capabilities to the masses. MiniMax Agent lets you spin up coding projects, reports, and slideshows alongside an autonomous AI teammate that seems at least on par with fellow Chinese counterpart Manus. For inspiration, you can scroll down to see what others have created, like a London airspace tracker, a virtual museum tour, and an SEO dashboard — complete with the prompts they used.\\n\\n2. Little-known startup races to fill Scale AI-shaped hole: With Meta purchasing a 49% stake in Scale and major players like OpenAI and Google heading for the door, an obscure startup called Surge AI is stepping out of the shadows as a worthy replacement. Like Scale, the 110-person company labels data for training frontier models. But it brought in $1B last year, fully bootstrapped, while $29B-valued Scale made only $870M in the same period. Surge is just one of a growing number of data-labeling startups that could stand to benefit from the Scale shakeup.\\n\\n3. MIT builds model that can continually teach itself: One thing that separates us from AI is that we have the ability to pick up new information and adjust our worldview accordingly. But that skill might not be exclusive to humans for long. MIT researchers developed a technique called Self Adapting Language Models (SEAL) that lets LLMs adjust their own parameters as they learn. The approach boosted the performance of Meta’s Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen, although pushing the models too much can actually lead them to start forgetting things.\\n\\n**FROM THE FRONTIER**\\n\\nAI is fueling a ‘solopreneur’ boom\\n\\nAI is getting so good, it can now replace real-life hosts. Source: CNBC/Screenshot\\n\\nA solo developer just sold his six-month-old ‘side-project’ for $80M: Maor Shlomo’s vibe-coding platform Base44, which helps non-programmers design their own software, was acquired by Wix as it looks to add more AI features to its website-building platform.\\n\\nWhile Shlomo’s startup didn’t stay “solo” for long (it eventually grew to include nine employees in total), its rate of growth and profitability, generating $189,000 of profit in May alone, would have been unheard of even a couple of years ago.\\n\\nAnother surprising application: Two AI avatars, trained on a real-life influencer and his co-host in China, just raised $7.65M in just seven hours via a livestream where they showed off different products. That’s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\\n\\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It’s to the point where a solo unicorn — a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation — doesn’t sound quite so far-fetched anymore. To keep up, bigger corporations will need to carve out small, nimble teams where employees can experiment and put AI to use in unexpected ways."\n    },\n    {\n      "title": "Veo dethroned by Chinese rivals",\n      "text": "Welcome back, Superhuman.

Two new video models jump past Veo 3 on major benchmark: Since Google’s Veo 3 release last month, it’s been the undisputed champion of VLMs — even making its way to primetime TV spots and Hollywood-backed short films. But its lead didn’t last for long: Artificial Analysis’s crowd-sourced leaderboard just ranked ByteDance’s Seedance 1.0 ahead of Veo across multiple categories. Meanwhile, MiniMax just revealed that a mysterious VLM known as “Kangaroo,” which beats Veo in image-to-video, is actually a brand-new model called Hailuo 02. The shakeup proves that Chinese AI companies are managing to stay competitive with their US counterparts.\\n\\n2. TikTok unveils new AI video tools: ByteDance just gave marketers an entirely new way to promote their products on TikTok. Advertisers can now generate five-second clips with either text or image prompts, then stitch them together to “bring a full product catalog to life.” For example, you can upload an image of a car, and then generate a video of it driving through a desert landscape. You can also prompt AI avatars to talk about your product and show it off, or even model your brand’s clothing.\\n\\n3. Adobe is helping brands brace for AI’s search shakeup: Retail sites saw a staggering 3,500% spike in traffic coming from generative AI sources in the past year. But while consumers are quickly embracing chatbot-based shopping, analytics tools have struggled to keep up. Adobe’s new LLM Optimizer aims to fix that — helping companies track how their content performs across AI platforms.

Source: Gallup\\n\\nThe US’s second-largest employer just dropped the hammer. In a new memo to his 1.5M+ employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy revealed that the company will likely see some job cuts in the near future as generative AI floods “virtually every corner of the company.”\\n\\nBut it’s not as grim as it sounds: Jassy said that while some positions are bound to be automated, other types of jobs will open up. Some of the best ways to prepare: “Be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms.”\\n\\nA new Gallup poll suggests many of us are already well on our way: About 40% of American employees have used AI at least a few times in the past year, up from just 21% the year before. Meanwhile, nearly one in five employees count themselves as frequent AI users, relying on LLMs at least a few times a week for work. (A new Microsoft report has some tips to help ease the transition.)\\n\\nWhat it means: In the past few months, we’ve finally seen CEOs be more upfront about AI’s impact on jobs. While that transparency can be daunting, it’s also an exciting time for the workforce. We have an active role in reshaping our daily workflows and can proactively create the jobs we envision.\\n\\nAI & TECH NEWS\\nEverything else you need to know today\\n\\nKrea’s new image model breaks new ground in the photorealism department.

For inspiration, you can scroll down to see what others have created, like a London airspace tracker, a virtual museum tour, and an SEO dashboard \\\\u2014 complete with the prompts they used.\\\\n\\\\n2. Little-known startup races to fill Scale AI-shaped hole: With Meta purchasing a 49% stake in Scale and major players like OpenAI and Google heading for the door, an obscure startup called Surge AI is stepping out of the shadows as a worthy replacement. Like Scale, the 110-person company labels data for training frontier models. But it brought in $1B last year, fully bootstrapped, while $29B-valued Scale made only $870M in the same period. Surge is just one of a growing number of data-labeling startups that could stand to benefit from the Scale shakeup.\\\\n\\\\n3. MIT builds model that can continually teach itself: One thing that separates us from AI is that we have the ability to pick up new information and adjust our worldview accordingly. But that skill might not be exclusive to humans for long. MIT researchers developed a technique called Self Adapting Language Models (SEAL) that lets LLMs adjust their own parameters as they learn. The approach boosted the performance of Meta\\\\u2019s Llama and Alibaba\\\\u2019s Qwen, although pushing the models too much can actually lead them to start forgetting things.\\\\n\\\\nFROM THE FRONTIER\\\\nAI is fueling a \\\\u2018solopreneur\\\\u2019 boom\\\\n\\\\nAI is getting so good, it can now replace real-life hosts.

That\\\\u2019s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\\\\n\\\\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It\\\\u2019s to the point where a solo unicorn \\\\u2014 a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation \\\\u2014 doesn\\\\u2019t sound quite so far-fetched anymore.

At $10/month, it\\\\u2019s significantly cheaper than other video generation models in the space, and according to Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, it can generate video styles that are hard to achieve with other video creation tools.\\\\n\\\\n2. Sam Altman drops GPT-5 timeline: In a podcast interview, the OpenAI CEO shared that GPT-5 is coming \\\\u201cprobably sometime this summer.\\\\u201c The model is expected to come with enhanced reasoning and agentic capabilities. Altman also alleged that Elon Musk tried to use his influence in government to compete unfairly against OpenAI.

For inspiration, you can scroll down to see what others have created, like a London airspace tracker, a virtual museum tour, and an SEO dashboard \\\\u2014 complete with the prompts they used.\\\\n\\\\n2. Little-known startup races to fill Scale AI-shaped hole: With Meta purchasing a 49% stake in Scale and major players like OpenAI and Google heading for the door, an obscure startup called Surge AI is stepping out of the shadows as a worthy replacement. Like Scale, the 110-person company labels data for training frontier models. But it brought in $1B last year, fully bootstrapped, while $29B-valued Scale made only $870M in the same period. Surge is just one of a growing number of data-labeling startups that could stand to benefit from the Scale shakeup.\\\\n\\\\n3. MIT builds model that can continually teach itself: One thing that separates us from AI is that we have the ability to pick up new information and adjust our worldview accordingly. But that skill might not be exclusive to humans for long. MIT researchers developed a technique called Self Adapting Language Models (SEAL) that lets LLMs adjust their own parameters as they learn. The approach boosted the performance of Meta\\\\u2019s Llama and Alibaba\\\\u2019s Qwen, although pushing the models too much can actually lead them to start forgetting things.\\\\n\\\\nFROM THE FRONTIER\\\\nAI is fueling a \\\\u2018solopreneur\\\\u2019 boom\\\\n\\\\nAI is getting so good, it can now replace real-life hosts.

That\\\\u2019s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\\\\n\\\\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It\\\\u2019s to the point where a solo unicorn \\\\u2014 a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation \\\\u2014 doesn\\\\u2019t sound quite so far-fetched anymore.

42a3514a-f50d-4d35-bbe9-eec11e0b8f8b	509411e7-531e-4fbb-b370-fa25557dbccb	The issue you're experiencing is related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy restrictions. Specifically, your frontend running on 'http://localhost:8080' is trying to make a request to 'https://earnlayer.com/signup?ref=default', but the server at earnlayer.com does not include the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in its response. This prevents the browser from allowing the request, resulting in a failed fetch and blocked request.\n\nHere's what you need to know and possible solutions:\n\n1. CORS Policy Explanation:\n- Browsers enforce CORS to prevent malicious scripts from making unauthorized requests.\n- The server must explicitly allow requests from your origin by including the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in its responses.\n\n2. Why the Error Occurs:\n- The request is a preflight OPTIONS request that fails because the server does not respond with the necessary headers.\n- This is common when making cross-origin requests that include custom headers or methods other than GET/POST.\n\n3. How to Fix or Work Around:\n- Server-Side Fix:\n  - Configure the server at earnlayer.com to include 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' or specify your origin.\n  - Ensure the server handles OPTIONS requests correctly and includes the necessary headers.\n- Development Environment:\n - Use a proxy server during development to route requests through your backend or a local proxy that adds CORS headers.\n  - For example, set up a local proxy or use tools like webpack-dev-server proxy configuration.\n- Frontend Workaround:\n  - Avoid making direct requests to the external domain from the frontend.\n - Instead, send requests to your own backend, which then makes server-to-server requests to earnlayer.com.\n - This way, CORS restrictions do not apply because the request is server-to-server.\n\n4. Additional Recommendations:\n- Check if earnlayer.com provides an API with proper CORS headers.\n- Contact the API provider to request CORS support if necessary.\n- For testing, you can disable CORS in your browser or use browser extensions, but this is not recommended for production.\n\nSummary:\nThe core issue is that the server at earnlayer.com does not permit cross-origin requests from your development environment. The best long-term solution is to have the server configured to include the appropriate CORS headers or to route requests through your backend server.\n\nWould you like guidance on setting up a proxy or modifying server configurations?	f	2025-07-15 13:26:52.643295+00

Here’s a simple, non-technical explanation of my previous message about AI video generation, plus a few extra tips and a relevant sponsor you might find helpful:\n\nWhat is AI video generation?\nAI video generation means using artificial intelligence (AI) to create videos automatically. Instead of filming with a camera, you can give the AI a picture or a short description, and it will make a video for you. For example, you could upload a photo of a dog, and the AI could turn it into a short video of the dog running or playing.\n\nHow does it work for beginners?\n- You don’t need to know how to code or be a tech expert.\n- Many tools (like Midjourney, Veo, and Adobe Firefly) let you type what you want to see, or upload a picture, and the AI does the rest.\n- Some tools are very affordable (for example, Midjourney’s video tool starts at $10/month).\n- You can control things like how long the video is, what style it has, and even how the camera moves.\n\nWhy is this exciting?\n- It saves a lot of time and money compared to traditional video making.\n- Anyone can make creative videos, even if you’ve never edited a video before.\n- Businesses and creators use these tools to make ads, social media posts, and more.\n\nSponsor tip: If you want to learn more about AI and how to use it for things like video, “The Best ChatGPT Book for Beginners” is a great resource. It covers how to use AI tools, create visuals, and even earn passive income. You can check it out on Amazon.\n\nIf you want to try making your own videos, tools like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate for Mac can help you edit and organize your videos easily—even if you’re just starting out.\n\nLet me know if you want a step-by-step guide or have any other questions about AI video tools!\n\n(Storing this summary for your future reference.)Here’s a simple explanation of AI video generation for beginners:\n\nAI video generation means using artificial intelligence to create videos automatically.

And if you want to edit or organize your videos, tools like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate for Mac are beginner-friendly.\n\nLet me know if you’d like a step-by-step guide or have more questions!	f	2025-07-23 17:27:55.790852+00

Here’s how the latest AI tools and platforms—like Toolhouse and AI video/image generation—can help you as a web designer, plus some practical examples and resources:\n\nHow AI Can Help Web Designers\n\n1. Effortless Content Creation\nAI video and image generators (like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and ByteDance’s Seedance) let you create custom visuals, animations, and even short product videos from simple prompts. This means you can quickly generate unique assets for client sites, landing pages, or social media—no need to wait for a photographer or videographer.\n\n2. Automate Repetitive Tasks\nAI agents (like those you can deploy with Toolhouse) can automate things like resizing images, generating alt text, or even building out basic page layouts from a wireframe or text description. This frees you up to focus on creative, high-value work.\n\n3. Boost Your Workflow\nPlatforms like Toolhouse let you define and deploy your own AI agents as APIs. For example, you could set up an agent to:\n- Instantly generate SEO-optimized blog post drafts for client sites\n- Summarize client feedback and turn it into actionable to-do lists\n- Create custom code snippets or CSS based on a design mockup4. Stay Ahead of the Curve\nAI is rapidly changing how people find and interact with websites. Adobe’s new LLM Optimizer, for example, helps brands track how their content performs in AI-driven searches (think: chatbots and voice assistants). As a web designer, understanding these tools means you can offer clients future-proof solutions.\n\n5. Solo or Small Team? No ProblemAI is fueling a “solopreneur” boom—tiny teams (or even solo designers) can now handle projects that used to require a full agency. With the right AI tools, you can scale your output, take on more clients, and even offer new services (like AI-powered chatbots or video content).\n\nPractical Example:\nLet’s say a client wants a landing page with a hero video, custom icons, and a testimonial section. With AI:\n- Generate a short, on-brand hero video using a tool like Midjourney or Firefly.\n- Create unique icons from text prompts.\n- Use an AI agent to summarize and format client testimonials for the site.\n\nWant to try building your own AI-powered workflow?

Here’s how a VPN can help you:\n\n- Privacy: A VPN hides your real IP address and encrypts your internet traffic. This means your online activity is much harder for hackers, advertisers, or even your internet provider to track.\n- Security: VPNs protect your data on public Wi-Fi (like in cafes or airports), making it much harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.\n- Access: VPNs let you access content that might be blocked or restricted in your country—think streaming services, news, or even some AI tools that are geo-locked.\n- AI & Productivity: If you’re using AI tools or platforms that are only available in certain regions, a VPN can help you get around those restrictions and try the latest features.\n\nIf you’re new to VPNs, it’s easy to get started. Services like NordVPN are beginner-friendly, fast, and secure. They even help protect you from phishing, scams, and malware, and you can secure up to 10 devices with one account. Right now, you can get 76% off NordVPN plus an Amazon gift card: [Buy Now](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-101484882-12814518).\n\nLet me know if you want a step-by-step guide to setting up a VPN or have questions about using one with AI tools!	f	2025-07-23 17:37:03.476793+00

The new Flash-Lite model is especially speedy and can be tuned for different “thinking” budgets, making it ideal for enterprise workflows.\n- MiniMax’s M1 model boasts a massive 1M-token context window—enough to process entire book collections at once. This leap in context size is enabling new kinds of business automation, like building dashboards or even Netflix-style apps with just prompts and agents.\n- Adobe Firefly has launched a mobile app, bringing AI-powered image and video generation to your phone. Firefly now integrates with major third-party models (Luma, Runway, Ideogram, Google, OpenAI), and its new Boards feature helps teams brainstorm and create digital mood boards on the go.\n- AI is rapidly reshaping the workplace: Nearly20% of US workers now use AI frequently, up from 21% last year. Companies like Amazon are openly discussing how generative AI will automate some jobs but also create new opportunities. The advice from leaders: get curious, experiment, and upskill with AI.\n- ByteDance’s Seedance and MiniMax’s Hailuo 02 have overtaken Google’s Veo 3 in video model benchmarks, showing that Chinese AI companies are highly competitive in enterprise video and content generation.\n- Adobe’s new LLM Optimizer helps brands track and boost their visibility across AI-driven search and chatbots, a must-have as generative AI becomes a major source of web traffic.\n- The “solopreneur” boom is real: AI is enabling tiny teams (sometimes just one person) to build and sell products at scale, with some solo startups reaching multi-million dollar exits in months.\n\nWant to dive deeper into any of these trends or see practical examples for your business?\n\n—\nSponsored picks to help you stay ahead:\n- Master AI with the Best ChatGPT Book for Beginners: Learn prompts, Dall-E visuals, AI ethics, and more.

From innovative applications in healthcare and education to pressing concerns around security and ethical considerations, AI continues its relentless march forward, reshaping industries and prompting important societal discussions.\n\nOne of the most notable stories centers on the rapid adoption of AI by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The agency has launched "INTACT," its first agency-wide AI tool, designed to enhance operational efficiency, streamline regulatory processes, and improve risk assessment. This marks a significant step towards AI-driven government transformation, demonstrating a commitment to leveraging AI for public service.\n\nHowever, the proliferation of AI also brings new challenges. Cybersecurity researchers have raised alarms about new malicious AI variants based on WormGPT, including strains built on popular models like Grok and Mixtral. These tools are being weaponized to automate phishing attacks and malware creation with advanced precision, highlighting the urgent need for stronger AI safety and security protocols.\n\nEducation is another area witnessing significant AI integration. Mississippi has partnered with Nvidia to launch a statewide AI education initiative for middle and high school students, aiming to prepare the next generation for technology careers. Similarly, Google continues its investment in AI for education, offering free access to tools like Gemini Advanced for college students and expanding AI literacy programs.\n\nBeyond government and education, individual achievements are also making headlines. A remarkable example is 16-year-old Pranjali Awasthi, who founded Delv.AI, a $12 million AI research startup focused on making academic data more accessible with Large Language Models (LLMs). Her inspiring story underscores the potential for young innovators to contribute significantly to the AI landscape.\n\nOn the ethical front, Wikipedia editors are pushing back against the increasing use of AI-generated content on the platform, citing concerns about accuracy, tone, and proper citation. This backlash reflects broader tensions between human moderation and machine-generated information, prompting discussions about maintaining quality and trustworthiness in the age of AI. Even religious leaders are weighing in, with Pope Leo XIV expressing concerns about AI's impact on youth development and urging developers to embed human dignity in AI design.	2025-06-22 14:48:18.95383+00	2025-06-22 14:48:18.95383+00	\N	published

This shift was underscored by Canada's new Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation, Evan Solomon, in a recent address, signalling a broader trend among nations.\n\nMinister Solomon, in his inaugural speech, emphasized that Canada will no longer "over-index on warnings and regulation," but instead prioritize ways to maximize the economic advantages offered by AI. While acknowledging the need to protect data and privacy, he suggested that a rigid, singular approach to AI regulation is impractical given the rapid pace of technological development and the varying interests of global players. "The United States and China have no desire to buy into any constraint or regulation," Solomon stated, highlighting the challenges of unilateral regulatory efforts.\n\nThis sentiment echoes a broader shift observed internationally. The initial global summits on AI safety, which heavily emphasized existential risks, are giving way to forums with a wider scope, now encompassing adoption strategies and economic integration. For instance, the recent AI Action Summit in Paris saw a distinct pushback against overly restrictive European regulatory efforts from the US Vice-President.\n\nCanada's new approach aims to foster its domestic AI industry, drive adoption across various sectors, and ensure Canadian trust and sovereignty over the technology. This includes government investments in data centers and research, intellectual property protection, and a strong focus on commercialization. The goal is to champion Canadian AI companies and encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to embrace AI, positioning the country to lead in this "Guttenberg moment" of technological revolution.\n\n\nWhile the need for ethical guidelines and safeguards remains, particularly concerning data protection and privacy, the overarching message from many governments is clear: the future of AI lies in defining, shaping, and leading its transformative potential for economic growth and innovation, rather than solely attempting to constrain it.	2025-06-22 14:48:18.95383+00	2025-06-22 14:48:18.95383+00	\N	published

You can now apparently build a lightweight Netflix clone with nothing more than an AI agent and some well-crafted prompts. And: Tech CEOs are finally starting to admit what we’ve all suspected: AI is coming for some of our jobs — but it might unlock even better opportunities in the process.\n\nAlso today: Learn how to create product videos with Higgsfield, and get the latest AI tools, prompts, and trending social media posts.\n\nTODAY IN AI\n\nAdobe is rolling out a series of new AI-powered updates for Firefly. Source: Adobe\n\n1. Google drops major Gemini 2.5 updates: The search giant revealed that Gemini 2.5 Pro, its most powerful model, is now out of preview and all set for developers to build on. The same is true for its smaller sibling, Gemini 2.5 Flash, which is designed for “fast all-around help.” Finally, a new model called 2.5 Flash-Lite is even speedier while beating its predecessor across math, science, and coding. It can also be assigned different “thinking” budgets if you want it to take on more complex tasks without jumping to the full Flash model.\n\n2. Open-source agent leaps to the front of the pack: Shanghai’s MiniMax just released a new model called M1 that features an enormous 1M-token context window — theoretically big enough to process an entire collection of books, compared to GPT-4o’s novel-length limit. It also edges out DeepSeek’s R1, despite that model getting a major upgrade only a few weeks ago. And it can supposedly handle everything from building a Netflix clone to whipping up a stock dashboard on its own.\n\n3. New mobile app unlocks on-the-go video generations: Adobe just unveiled a mobile version of Firefly, its commercially-safe image and video generation platform. It’s also rolling out Boards, an AI-powered digital mood board that can help you piece together creative ideas — now with video-gen folded in. Plus, you can access just about every major third-party video and image model inside Firefly, including newcomers from Luma, Runway, and Ideogram, as well as staples from Google and OpenAI.\n\nFROM THE FRONTIER\nAI is already reshaping the workplace\n\nNearly 20% of American workers use AI on a “frequent” basis. Source: Gallup\n\nThe US’s second-largest employer just dropped the hammer. In a new memo to his 1.5M+ employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy revealed that the company will likely see some job cuts in the near future as generative AI floods “virtually every corner of the company.”\n\nBut it’s not as grim as it sounds: Jassy said that while some positions are bound to be automated, other types of jobs will open up. Some of the best ways to prepare: “Be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms.”\n\nA new Gallup poll suggests many of us are already well on our way: About 40% of American employees have used AI at least a few times in the past year, up from just 21% the year before. Meanwhile, nearly one in five employees count themselves as frequent AI users, relying on LLMs at least a few times a week for work. (A new Microsoft report has some tips to help ease the transition.)\n\nWhat it means: In the past few months, we’ve finally seen CEOs be more upfront about AI’s impact on jobs. While that transparency can be daunting, it’s also an exciting time for the workforce. We have an active role in reshaping our daily workflows and can proactively create the jobs we envision.\n\nAI & TECH NEWS\nEverything else you need to know today\n\nKrea’s new image model breaks new ground in the photorealism department.

If you’ve been dabbling in AI image generation since the early days, you probably know that Midjourney is a fan favorite. But other AI labs have beaten Midjourney to video models over the last year. The company’s long-awaited video model is here at long last — and packs a serious punch.\n\nAlso: Sam Altman makes some big allegations, Meta continues its spending splurge, and learn how to find hidden insights with today’s prompt.\n\nTODAY IN AI\n\nClick here to watch Midjourney’s new video generation model V1 in action. Source: Midjourney\n\n1. Midjourney launches its first AI video generation model: The startup just dropped V1, which lets you turn any image into a set of 4 five-second video clips. The model can extend clips up to 21 seconds and allows users to tweak camera movement and animation styles. At $10/month, it’s significantly cheaper than other video generation models in the space, and according to Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, it can generate video styles that are hard to achieve with other video creation tools.\n\n2. Sam Altman drops GPT-5 timeline: In a podcast interview, the OpenAI CEO shared that GPT-5 is coming “probably sometime this summer.“ The model is expected to come with enhanced reasoning and agentic capabilities. Altman also alleged that Elon Musk tried to use his influence in government to compete unfairly against OpenAI. In a separate interview, Altman also claimed that Meta is offering OpenAI’s top employees $100M bonuses to lure them away.\n\n3. Meta reportedly continues its aggressive talent acquisition spree: Not to be deterred by allegations of $100M pay packages, the social media giant is reportedly courting former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and investor Daniel Gross to join its leadership team. Meta may also potentially buy out part of their venture fund NFDG. The duo has backed major AI startups like Perplexity, Eleven Labs, and Safe Superintelligence.\n\nIN THE KNOW\nWhat’s trending on socials and headlines today\n\n🧠 Brain Drain: MIT just ran a study that measures the effects of ChatGPT on student brains and the results don’t look great.\n\n✨ Reality Check: Someone asked ChatGPT the top 10 things humanity should know and put the chatbot’s response up on Reddit in a post that has since blown up.\n\n✍️ Reality Filter: A ChatGPT and Gemini user claims to have created a prompt that stops these chatbots from hallucinating and gaslighting you.\n\n💡 Builders Delight: Andrej Karpathy's keynote at YC’s AI Startup School is blowing up.

The robotaxi company would initially operate with trained specialists behind the wheel since state law doesn't allow fully autonomous drives yet. The move comes as Tesla prepares to kick off its limited robotaxi operations in Austin.\n\n2. Hexagon taps Nvidia Robotics to deploy its humanoid robot: The company has unveiled AEON, a humanoid robot built with Nvidia’s simulation platform for manufacturing and logistics tasks. The industrial bot hopes to tackle critical labor shortages by performing reality capture — automatically scanning assets and environments to generate precise 3D models. Using Nvidia’s Omniverse platform, AEON mastered core locomotion skills in just 2-3 weeks instead of the typical 5-6 months.\n\n3. Researchers claim they’ve built the ‘first flying humanoid robot’ : Italian researchers have unveiled the iRonCub3, a jet-powered humanoid robot that they claim successfully hovered to about 50cm off the ground during its first test flight. Not exactly breaking altitude records, but still a significant leap. Unlike traditional drones, the robot must balance an entire humanoid body with movable limbs while adapting to complex, ever-changing aerodynamics. See it in action here.\n\nROBOTS IN ACTION\nHow robots are transforming the world around us\n\nDr. Kenneth Liao performs the first successful, fully robotic heart transplant in the US.

Instead of the traditional method of breaking the breastbone, doctors made small incisions in the abdomen, using robotic tools to remove the diseased heart and implant a donor organ.\n\nGas Guardian: A single undetected gas leak can cost facilities over $57,000 per year and pose a major safety risk in petrochemical plants. Now, Swiss robotics company ANYbotics has equipped its ANYmal robot with gas leak detection capabilities, enabling the quadruped to pinpoint invisible leaks that manual inspections often miss.\n\nBlade Runner: KUKA has unveiled the Catonator, a remote-controlled robotic saw armed with 2,000mm blades that can slice through steel, concrete, and aerospace composites with 0.1mm precision. It could potentially automate precision cutting tasks while eliminating emissions and improving worker safety in heavy industry applications.\n\nINDUSTRY SNAPSHOT\nEverything else you need to know this week\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nHere are the biggest developments in the robotics space that you should know about:\n\nTesla has been asked by Democratic lawmakers to put off its robotaxi launch until September, when new regulations with stricter state oversight take effect.\n\nAnduril is joining hands with German giant Rheinmetall to build military drones for European markets — a shift toward faster innovation in European defense.\n\nA recent Gallup poll shows that 15% of US workers believe that AI or robots may likely replace their jobs.\n\nAmazon's Zoox just opened its first production facility in Hayward, California, where it eventually expects to build over 10,000 electric AVs annually.\n\nEngineAI has open-sourced a dev suite designed to accelerate humanoid robot creation by removing technical barriers for startups and researchers.\n\nUS startup Skydweller Aero has partnered up with French defense company Thales to deploy a solar-powered drone that can stay in flight for a whole month.\n\nPrismaX has launched with $11M to solve one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics — a lack of high-quality training data for AI models.\n\nROBOT OF THE WEEK\nA robot that caught our eye this week\n\nSource: Beatbot\n\nBeatbot’s AquaSense 2 is making waves as a Roomba for your swimming pool.\n\nThe robotic pool cleaner uses HybridSense AI mapping, 27 sensors, and 11 motors to clean floors, walls, waterlines, and the water surface automatically while also offering water clarification. It can take on pools up to 3,875 square feet and runs for up to 10 hours on a single charge for surface cleaning.\n\nYou can check it out here.\n\nROBO REEL\nWatch: Inventor builds real-life Transformer that shape-shifts into a ride\n\nBruton's robot is a feat of practical engineering, designed with eagle-eyed detail.

Researchers claim they’ve uncovered one of the largest data hacks ever recorded. If confirmed, it’d mean up to 16B of our private credentials from platforms like Google and Apple might be compromised.\n\nAlso today: Learn how to generate ChatGPT images in WhatsApp, and get the latest AI tools and trending social media posts.\n\nTODAY IN AI\n\nMiniMax is going after rivals like OpenAI and Butterfly Effect with a browser-based agent. Source: MiniMax\n\n1. You can now try MiniMax’s general agent for yourself: The Alibaba-backed startup is bringing its models’ reasoning capabilities to the masses. MiniMax Agent lets you spin up coding projects, reports, and slideshows alongside an autonomous AI teammate that seems at least on par with fellow Chinese counterpart Manus. For inspiration, you can scroll down to see what others have created, like a London airspace tracker, a virtual museum tour, and an SEO dashboard — complete with the prompts they used.\n\n2. Little-known startup races to fill Scale AI-shaped hole: With Meta purchasing a 49% stake in Scale and major players like OpenAI and Google heading for the door, an obscure startup called Surge AI is stepping out of the shadows as a worthy replacement. Like Scale, the 110-person company labels data for training frontier models. But it brought in $1B last year, fully bootstrapped, while $29B-valued Scale made only $870M in the same period. Surge is just one of a growing number of data-labeling startups that could stand to benefit from the Scale shakeup.\n\n3. MIT builds model that can continually teach itself: One thing that separates us from AI is that we have the ability to pick up new information and adjust our worldview accordingly. But that skill might not be exclusive to humans for long. MIT researchers developed a technique called Self Adapting Language Models (SEAL) that lets LLMs adjust their own parameters as they learn. The approach boosted the performance of Meta’s Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen, although pushing the models too much can actually lead them to start forgetting things.\n\nFROM THE FRONTIER\nAI is fueling a ‘solopreneur’ boom\n\nAI is getting so good, it can now replace real-life hosts. Source: CNBC/Screenshot\n\nA solo developer just sold his six-month-old ‘side-project’ for $80M: Maor Shlomo’s vibe-coding platform Base44, which helps non-programmers design their own software, was acquired by Wix as it looks to add more AI features to its website-building platform.\n\nWhile Shlomo’s startup didn’t stay “solo” for long (it eventually grew to include nine employees in total), its rate of growth and profitability, generating $189,000 of profit in May alone, would have been unheard of even a couple of years ago.\n\nAnother surprising application: Two AI avatars, trained on a real-life influencer and his co-host in China, just raised $7.65M in just seven hours via a livestream where they showed off different products. That’s allegedly more than the real-life hosts had managed during previous streams.\n\nThe big takeaway: AI is making startups smaller and smaller, as founders start to hand off increasingly complex tasks to agents. It’s to the point where a solo unicorn — a single-person startup with at least a $1B valuation — doesn’t sound quite so far-fetched anymore. To keep up, bigger corporations will need to carve out small, nimble teams where employees can experiment and put AI to use in unexpected ways.\n\nAI ACADEMY\nHow to generate ChatGPT images in WhatsApp\n\nOpen WhatsApp on your phone.\n\nSend the message “Link my WhatsApp with ChatGPT” to 1-800-ChatGPT.\n\nYou’ll receive a link—tap it to connect your WhatsApp with your ChatGPT account\n\nNow you can prompt ChatGPT within WhatsApp to generate images for you.\n\nSample Prompt: Can you create me a white fluffy cat made of rice wrapped in a strip of seaweed around its stomach\n\nWait a few seconds, and ChatGPT will generate an image for you.\n\nIN THE KNOW\nWhat’s trending on socials and headlines today\n\nWatch what happened when a UCLA graduate showed off all his ChatGPT-generated final projects during his graduation ceremony.\n\n♟️ Masterful Move: Duolingo built a full chess course from scratch with just two employees and the AI coding tool Cursor.

A new report suggests its once unshakeable partnership with Microsoft could be in jeopardy. Plus: A surprise video model leaps past Veo 3, and Adobe has a plan to help companies boost their visibility on AI chatbots and browsers.\n\nAlso today: Learn how to automate your web browsing with AI, and get the latest AI tools and trending social media posts.\n\nTODAY IN AI\n\nByteDance’s Seedance model just claimed the top spot in a popular benchmark.\n\n1. Two new video models jump past Veo 3 on major benchmark: Since Google’s Veo 3 release last month, it’s been the undisputed champion of VLMs — even making its way to primetime TV spots and Hollywood-backed short films. But its lead didn’t last for long: Artificial Analysis’ crowd-sourced leaderboard just ranked ByteDance’s Seedance 1.0 ahead of Veo across multiple categories. Meanwhile, MiniMax just revealed that a mysterious VLM known as “Kangaroo,” which beats Veo in image-to-video, is actually a brand-new model called Hailuo 02. The shakeup proves that Chinese AI companies are managing to stay competitive with their US counterparts.\n\n2. TikTok unveils new AI video tools: ByteDance just gave marketers an entirely new way to promote their products on TikTok. Advertisers can now generate five-second clips with either text or image prompts, then stitch them together to “bring a full product catalog to life.” For example, you can upload an image of a car, and then generate a video of it driving through a desert landscape. You can also prompt AI avatars to talk about your product and show it off, or even model your brand’s clothing.\n\n3. Adobe is helping brands brace for AI’s search shakeup: Retail sites saw a staggering 3,500% spike in traffic coming from generative AI sources in the past year. But while consumers are quickly embracing chatbot-based shopping, analytics tools have struggled to keep up. Adobe’s new LLM Optimizer aims to fix that — helping companies track how their content performs across AI platforms. It also boosts discoverability, sort of like SEO for LLMs, so your products are more likely to surface in AI-driven searches.\n\nFROM THE FRONTIER\nReport: Microsoft and OpenAI face a bitter breakup\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft’s close relationship could be souring. Source: Analytics India Magazine\n\nIt looks like Microsoft and OpenAI’s six-year partnership — one of the closest collaborations in the industry — might have finally reached a tipping point.\n\nIt was a match made in heaven: As far back as 2019, Microsoft has been giving OpenAI cloud access and billions in investments in exchange for exclusive rights to the ChatGPT-maker’s models. But now that OpenAI has become a massively successful tech company in its own right, it wants more independence and flexibility.\n\nHow so? OpenAI has been trying for months to transform into a public-benefit corporation, giving it a chance to turn a profit and accelerate its growth. The one thing holding it back: Microsoft won’t budge on the details out of fear it’ll get burned in the process.\n\nHigh Stakes: According to the Wall Street Journal, the feud has gotten so heated that OpenAI is now considering going public with its accusations. It could also ask the federal government to investigate Microsoft for antitrust violations.\n\nNot so fast: In a joint statement, both companies agreed they’re “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” hinting that there might still be time to smooth things over.\n\nAI & TECH NEWS\nEverything else you need to know today\n\nA team of researchers used GPT-4.1 and o3-mini-high to shave off years of research time.
